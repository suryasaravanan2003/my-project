This repository contains three Python-based command-line applications developed as part of the SyntechXHub Internship Program.
Each project demonstrates core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, user input handling, and file I/O.

🚀 Project Overview
📘 Project 1: Simple Calculator

A menu-driven command-line calculator that supports:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

Input validation and divide-by-zero handling

Clean modular functions for each operation

A continuous loop for repeated calculations

This project demonstrates:

Function creation

Error handling

Command-line interaction

🎯 Project 2: Number Guessing Game

An interactive game where the user guesses a randomly chosen number.

Features:

Easy, Medium, Hard difficulty levels

Higher/Lower hints to guide the user

Attempt counter to measure performance

Replay option using loop logic

Concepts demonstrated:

Random number generation

Conditional statements

Loops & user feedback

📌 Project 3: To-Do List Manager

A menu-based task manager with file persistence.

Features:

Add, view, delete, and mark tasks as done

Stores data in a JSON file (tasks.json) so tasks persist even after exiting

Clean separation between logic and I/O functions

Demonstrates:

File handling

JSON serialization

Data structures (lists & dictionaries)

Modular program design

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

JSON for file storage

CLI (Command Line Interface)
